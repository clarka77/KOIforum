## Synopsis

I am the solo developer on this project.  I am making a WordPress theme to connect with others of like mind who are disciples of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

## Motivation

I am doing this project for learning purposes and because the time dictates that it needs to be done.

## Installation

I will install this website using unmanaged VPS hosting, no control panel, and Cloudflare.

## Tests

I will test the site myself in different browsers and devices.  I will also conduct various speed tests.

## Contributors

This is a solo project and no other contributors will be needed in building this WordPress theme, however volunteers are welcome to maintain and improve upon it.

## License

This project is governed by The Unlicense.  This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
